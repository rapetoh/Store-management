# Centralized API Logging Migration Guide

## Overview

We've implemented a centralized logging system that automatically logs API activities without requiring manual logging calls in components. This replaces the scattered manual logging throughout the application.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **API Logging Wrapper (`lib/apiLogger.ts`)**
- `withAutoLogging()` - Automatically wraps API routes with logging
- `getAutoLogContext()` - Intelligently determines what to log based on route and method
- Captures request/response data, financial impact, and performance metrics
- Handles errors gracefully without breaking API functionality

### 2. **Automatic Route Detection**
The system automatically logs:
- **Sales**: POST (new sales), DELETE (sale cancellations)
- **Products**: POST (creation), PUT/PATCH (updates), DELETE (removal)
- **Inventory**: Stock adjustments with financial impact
- **Categories**: CRUD operations
- **Suppliers**: CRUD operations
- **Customers**: CRUD operations
- **Cash Sessions**: Opening, closing, modifications

### 3. **Already Migrated Routes**
✅ `/api/sales` - Both GET and POST handlers
✅ `/api/products` - Both GET and POST handlers

## Testing the Implementation

Run the test script to verify centralized logging is working:

```bash
node scripts/test-centralized-logging.js
```

This will show:
- Recent logs with API metadata
- Ratio of centralized vs manual logs
- Performance metrics (duration, status codes)

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: ✅ **Core Infrastructure (DONE)**
- [x] Create API logging wrapper
- [x] Implement auto-detection logic
- [x] Migrate sales API
- [x] Migrate products API

### Phase 2: **Expand Coverage**
- [ ] Migrate `/api/categories`
- [ ] Migrate `/api/suppliers`
- [ ] Migrate `/api/customers`
- [ ] Migrate `/api/inventory/*`
- [ ] Migrate `/api/cash`

### Phase 3: **Remove Manual Logging**
- [ ] Remove `ActivityLogger` calls from `components/Products.tsx`
- [ ] Remove `universalLogger` calls from `components/Orders.tsx`
- [ ] Remove logging from `components/Settings.tsx`
- [ ] Remove logging from `components/SupplierManagement.tsx`
- [ ] Remove logging from `components/CategoryManagement.tsx`

### Phase 4: **Cleanup**
- [ ] Remove unused `lib/logger.ts`
- [ ] Remove unused `lib/universalLogger.ts`
- [ ] Update imports in remaining components

## How to Migrate a Route

### 1. Add the import:
```typescript
import { withAutoLogging } from '@/lib/apiLogger'
```

### 2. Convert handler functions:
```typescript
// Before
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // ... handler logic
}

// After
const postHandler = async (request: NextRequest) => {
  // ... handler logic (unchanged)
}

export const POST = withAutoLogging(postHandler)
```

### 3. Remove manual logging:
Remove any `ActivityLogger` or `universalLogger` calls from the handler.

## Benefits

### ✅ **Immediate Benefits**
1. **Consistency** - All API calls logged uniformly
2. **Performance** - Automatic timing and status tracking
3. **Maintenance** - No manual logging to maintain
4. **Error Tracking** - Automatic error logging
5. **Audit Trail** - Complete API usage history

### ✅ **Data Captured**
- HTTP method, path, status code
- Request/response timing
- Financial impact (automatic calculation)
- User context (when available)
- Error details with stack traces

### ✅ **Preserved Functionality**
- All existing logs remain intact
- No breaking changes to current features
- Gradual migration without disruption

## Monitoring

### Log Structure
Centralized logs include metadata:
```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "path": "/api/sales",
  "statusCode": 201,
  "duration": 125,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T10:00:00.000Z",
  "hasRequestBody": true,
  "hasResponseData": true
}
```

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **Response times** - Ensure no performance degradation
2. **Error rates** - Monitor for logging-related issues
3. **Log volume** - Verify all expected activities are captured
4. **Missing logs** - Check for gaps in audit trail

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Comment out `withAutoLogging()` wrapper
2. Restore original `export async function` syntax
3. Re-enable manual logging temporarily
4. Investigate and fix issues
5. Re-apply centralized logging

## Next Steps

1. **Test Current Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Make some API calls through the UI, then:
   node scripts/test-centralized-logging.js
   ```

2. **Migrate More Routes** (in order of priority)
   - Categories (high usage)
   - Inventory adjustments (financial impact)
   - Suppliers (business critical)

3. **Monitor Logs Dashboard**
   - Verify automatic logs appear in the Logs section
   - Check for proper financial impact calculation
   - Ensure user attribution works

4. **Gradually Remove Manual Logging**
   - Start with components that have centralized routes
   - Test thoroughly before removing each manual logger

## Questions & Issues

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API responses are still working
3. Run the test script to check log generation
4. Check database for new activity logs with metadata

The centralized system is designed to be **additive and safe** - it won't break existing functionality and can be disabled quickly if needed.
